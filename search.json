I was an active participant in RSECon2024 (supporting a team member in delivering the RSE Regional Groups SIG Meeting) and in RSE Midlands 2024 (giving a lightning talk on my experience of managing the RSE Service at the University of Birmingham).\nAs a software developer at Arup I contributed to several annual Users’ Meetings for our software, including chairing a roundtable discussion on Green Software initiatives (2023). I organised several similar discussions internally at both Midlands and UK events.\nAs an academic researcher I gave numerous presentations on my research, including at the British Young Mathematicians Colloquium (2016), the 9th International Plant Biomechanics Conference in Montreal (2018), and the UK Fluids Conference in Manchester (2018). I also participated in the 2016 and 2017 Multi-Scale Biology Study Group at the University of Birmingham, taking a leading role in presenting our work and organising the final written reports in both years."
